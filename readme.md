# Tech Stacks
The purpose of this repo is to list out the languages, libraries, and tools I like to use for projects. I tend to forget what I've used in the past, and  why I chose it, so I'm hoping this will help with the inevitable analysis paralysis that comes with starting a project. I also want to add things I'd like to try in the future.

### Front End

 - For large, dynamic, feature rich Front Ends (FE), Angular is my framework of choice. The batteries included approach to everything, from routing, HTTP requests, and *especially* Dependency Injection, is hard to beat when developing a complex application.
   - I use the Angular CLI to start and develop Angular apps.

 - For smaller -- but still dynamic and interactive -- apps, I have been enjoying React. I know it is fully capable of being used for larger projects (case in point: FaceBook), but I prefer Angular for such a task. By keeping the TS and HTML in a single file, unlike Angular, it guides me to write smaller, simpler components.
   - I have had success using Vite to start and develop React apps.

 - For static websites, I have been using Astro. It has great DX, runs fast, codes similar to React, and probably does a bunch of stuff I don't even know about. I don't think it would be great for a 'Web Application'-type website, but for content-focused sites it works great. I'd like to try out their [templates](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples) one day.

 - Blazor is a wild card. I won't use Blazor unless I specifically have a .NET backend (is it even possible to use a non-C# backend...?). It's a really fast way to build an MVP. I'm not sure how well it would scale with a multitude of features or interactivity requirements. In my relatively inexperienced opinion, it's got a specific use case as a basic front end for some sort of .NET service or class library. Blazor WASM could definitely help improve this, though.
