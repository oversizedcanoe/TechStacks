# Tech Stacks
The purpose of this repo is to list out my preferred languages, libraries, and tools to use for projects. I tend to forget which ones I've used in the past, and  why I chose them, so I'm hoping this will help with the inevitable analysis paralysis that comes with starting a project. I also want to add things I'd like to try in the future.

## Front End
- Large applications: Angular
  - Batteries included (routing, HTTP requests, DI, etc)
  - Use Angular CLI to start up

- Small applications: React
  - Helps to force smaller components due to TS/HTML being in one file
  - Use Vite to start up

- Static websites: Astro
  - Great DX, runs fast, good for content-focused sites, not necessarily reactivity/SPA stuff
  - I want to try their [templates](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples)

- Occaisionally: Blazor
  - Good for building an MVP for a C# background service type application

### CSS
- Bootstrap is good but seems to be everywhere, making a bunch of sites look the same
- [Pure CSS](https://pure-css.github.io/) is great for simple websites/minimal styling
- [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/) is another favorite of mine, great for semantic styling/CSS reset
 
## Back End
- Large Applications: .NET Core
  - Similar to Angular reasoning, batteries included framework

- Small Applications: Python
  - [Falcon](https://falcon.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for APIs
  
## Database
- SQL Server at work, Postgres at home
- SQLite for simple/local projects
- Want to try a NoSQL database in the future

## Desktop
- I don't really build desktop apps. I have experence with WinForms and WPF but that's about it

## Moblile
- I only have (extremely limited) experience building native apps with Ionic. I didn't do much with it, but it was nice and easy to use
- Want to try Expo and/or React Native in the future
